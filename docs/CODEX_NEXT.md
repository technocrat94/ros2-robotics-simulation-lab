# Next task for Codex

Written by Claude (reviewer). Read this file at the start of a session after `git pull`.

**Standing rule for every task:** a task is done only when the commit is on GitHub. Commit, run
`git push origin <branch>`, then check that `git ls-remote origin <branch>` equals `git rev-parse HEAD`.
"Everything up-to-date" means nothing new was pushed; it is not success. Reply with the pushed hash.

## Local pre-merge status

Pending: wrap-up only (v4 deferred to next week)

## Working tree note

Leave the deleted 05_c2_tall_wall_refused.png and the untracked curobo/ untouched. Stage files by
explicit path only. No git clean/reset/restore/stash/add -A.

## Task now: wrap up for today (2026-11-13). Do NOT start v4.

1. If v3 work is not all pushed, push it. Check `git ls-remote origin experiment/newton-link-depth-camera`
   equals `git rev-parse HEAD`, and `git status -sb` shows no "ahead".
2. Check these exist on the remote branch: scripts/curobo_moving_rod_v3.py, _v3_live.py, _v3_viewer.py,
   scripts/run_sim_camera_moving_rod_v3.sh, results moving_rod_v3.{json,log,reference.json},
   section "v3 fixed rules" in docs/SIM_CAMERA_MOVING_ROD.md. Report any missing.
3. Stop only processes you started (viewer/worker/batch). List them before stopping.
4. Do not touch curobo/ or the deleted png. No new experiments.
Reply: pushed hash, check list ok/missing, processes stopped. Then the user runs `codex logout`.

## Deferred to next week (spec ready, do not start until Claude says so)

### rod dodge v4: floor, unseen rod top, visible prediction (2026-11-13)

v3 (56ea2c3) is reviewed. B 50/50, E 10/50, repeats identical, so 1 repeat is enough now.
Claude checked the 10 E collision onsets (repeat 1): 4 had no box for the whole last 0.3 s (rod out of
view); 6 had a box but its top was 0.05-0.17 m while the rod is 0.25 m, and it lagged 3-5 cm in X.
The arm hit the part it never saw. Also the MPC world has no floor (only `camera_obstacle`), so the
arm may pass through the floor and scoring would not count it.

Keep every v3 rule unchanged except these three. New files `*_v4*`; do not change v3 code or results.

1. Floor: add a static floor cuboid to the MPC world (top at z=0, or just below if base spheres touch
   it; say which). Score floor contact for all links except the base as a collision too. Check that
   start, goal and raised start are clear.
2. Principle for E: what the camera has not confirmed is treated as occupied.
   a. Unseen top: today the top is observed + 20 mm unless the top point is near camera height. Change
      for the rod case: if the fresh cluster touches any image border, set the box top to the fixed
      `fixed_unknown_top_m` (0.545 m, fixed world value, never camera-relative). Log how often.
   b. Out of view: today memory points stay where they were seen for up to 1 s, so the box stays behind
      while the rod moves away (Claude found box X 0.405-0.468 vs rod X 0.378 at an E collision).
      Instead, while the rod is not seen, grow the remembered box in X and Y by 0.20 m/s x time since
      last seen (0.20 = assumed max rod speed, state it), keep the top rule from 2a, drop after 1 s as
      before. Log the grown size.
   Do not add active "go and look" behaviour; MPC still only tracks the goal.
3. Make prediction visible (replay and interactive):
   - observed box (orange) and predicted swept box (blue) with a legend text in the GUI;
   - a ghost rod where E thinks the rod will be at +0.43 s, and an arrow for estimated velocity;
   - GUI text: estimated vs true rod speed;
   - a checkbox to hide/show prediction in replay.
4. Prediction on/off groups so the report can show why it matters:
   A, B, B-nopred, E, E-nopred. Speeds 0.05, 0.10, 0.20 m/s, 5 phases, 1 repeat, A once (75 runs).
   INVALID_SCENE rule as before. Quiet background run, one line per case, do not read the full log.

Report table per group and speed: success/valid, collision runs, worst clearance, floor contacts,
how often 2a and 2b fired (E), and whether E still has collisions with no box or a box not covering the rod. Add section "v4" to `docs/SIM_CAMERA_MOVING_ROD.md` and a Chinese
table to the zh-TW report with replay and interactive commands. Reply with hash, table, commands.
